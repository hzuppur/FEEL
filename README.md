# FEEL
FEEL – a web‐tool/app for creating inner safe space to feel. 

### Why and for whom? 
This app/program introduces some basic self‐help techniques to increase emotional awareness and 
acceptance , and a structure for choosing right technique for current moment. Techniques are derived 
from mindfulness and acceptance‐based methods in psychotherapy.
Being more in contact with feelings leads to better understanding and fulfilling of our emotional needs 
and communication with others, and in longer term relieves stress, and prevents psychiatric disorders. 
This self‐help tool is not meant to be used as a substitute to psychotherapy in case of psychiatric 
disorders, but it can be used as a tool complementing psychotherapy
